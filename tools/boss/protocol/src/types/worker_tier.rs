//! Typed refusals for the worker RPC tier.
//!
//! A frontend connection whose socket peer descends from a registered worker
//! pane shell executes at *worker tier*: it may read the work taxonomy,
//! submit proposals, and call the handful of sanctioned telemetry verbs — and
//! nothing else. Everything outside that set comes back as a
//! [`WorkerTierDenial`] instead of executing.
//!
//! The refusal is typed for the same reason a proposal refusal is (see
//! [`crate::ProposalSubmissionError`]): the worker on the other end is an LLM
//! that has to decide what to do next, and "denied" is not an instruction.
//! [`WorkerTierDenial::use_instead`] carries the verb it should have called —
//! usually a `boss propose …` — so the remediation is mechanical rather than
//! inferred from prose.
//!
//! Design: `tools/boss/docs/designs/worker-proposal-api-replace-fragile-worker-to-engine-seams.md`
